Hi, I'm Jan. I recently moved to the USA to complete my studies there. Over the past 4 years, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and IT, after which I started focusing much more on the mathematical side of things.

I am immensely interested in numerical research and real world applications of scientific computing, among a lot of other things.
